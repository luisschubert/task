#task - personal task manager
I created this project to keep track of how i spend my time.
The first step I took was to create a program that will allow me to start "tasks" and track the starting/end time as well as the duration of the task.
After completion of the task it is written to a text file.
The next step is to create a program that will parse the data and make sense of it.
I plan on using the bokeh library for visualization.

There is basically two parts to this project.
Finding an efficient way to record tasks.
Finding a way to visualize the recorded task data.

I don't want to be using textfiles. But because of the simplicity and ease of implementation I've stuck with that so far.

##Future Features
- Text Message Interface to end and start tasks
- Ability to add task with start time that is less than to the current time
- Visualization of tasks to comprehend time spent
